So, bahacly it's real-time text-adventure game.

Which means we have events that start and end without user (user-initiated exist too, obviously).

Why? Dunno, just wanted to. In supreme condition library code (TimeLineScheluder and SceneComposer) will be released full-time as library to create real-time 'VN's, first one would be to plan and manipulate timeline of a game and second'd be editor to easily create scenes and interconnect them.

Example why it's so cool of a concept (I do know that I'm dumb and it's not cool, probably):

We have our player visited by king on a hunting trip - player does nothing, it was a king's wish to go hunting - so player have to oblige and either get out of the way and let king's servants handle things (do nothing or just be idle) or interviene (is that right word? I'd said that I'm dumb) and get better opinion from king or increased payout, or any other benefits (or get executed)

(Note, ganja game is about king's forester that got his post inherited from father)

What's so cool about it (again)? We transition from silly game settings into real-life-like simulation - we aren't world's god that can pause time and think indefinetelly what to choose and what actions to trigger. (The why we have real-time games nowadays)

Second part is that we introduce active part into somewhat (mechanically) dull event-based text game.
